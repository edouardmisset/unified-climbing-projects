# Climbing App

This is my pet project: climbing app ü§ì.
‚ö†Ô∏è It's a work in progress.
I like to explore new technologies, new frameworks, new libraries. This project
is my playground for these experiments.

## TODO

- [ ] Merge QR-Code pages and Barcode pages for training and ascents into one
  page. Use a switch to change from training to ascents. Use a button-group to
  change visualisation type (barcode or QR-code).
- [ ] Add auth (Clerk)
- [ ] Add database (Postgres)
 -[ ] Attach database to UI
- [ ] Add ORM (Drizzle)
- [ ] Change communication between front and back from tRPC to RSC for better
  performance (better caching)
- [ ] Add tests (visual non-regression tests for graphs, calendars, QR-codes,
  Barcodes, etc.)
- [ ] Add CI/CD
- [ ] Add error management (w/ Sentry)
- [ ] Analytics (posthog)
- [ ] Update Log page (w/ Server Actions)
- [ ] Update the Log page UI to allow for logging an ascent **OR** a training
  session. (use next.js layout)
- [ ] Update the Dashboard page to display the graphs in a carousel (use lib ?)
  and lazy load the graphs.
- [ ] Rate limiting ? (upstash)
