/* From https://moderncss.dev/12-modern-css-one-line-upgrades/#scrollbar-gutter
In some scenarios, the appearance or disappearance of scrollbars can cause an
unwanted layout shift. For example, when a dialog overlay is displayed and the
background page adds overflow: hidden to prevent scrolling, causing a shift from
removing the no longer needed scrollbars.
The modern CSS property scrollbar-gutter enables a reservation of space for
scrollbars in the layout, which prevents that undesirable shift. When thereâ€™s no
need for a scrollbar, the browser will still paint a gutter as extra space
created in addition to any padding on the scroll container.
